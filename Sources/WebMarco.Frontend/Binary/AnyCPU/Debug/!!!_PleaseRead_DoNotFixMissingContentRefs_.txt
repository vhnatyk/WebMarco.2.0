For some inexplicable reason (most probably because of the bug of Visual Studio:) 
- both $(Platform) and $(PlatformName) variables are set to empty and 
then default to "AnyCPU" for content files in 

<Content Include="Binary\$(PlatformName)\$(ConfigurationName)...

and setting defaults explicitly for empty values with

    <Configuration Condition=" '$(Configuration)' == '' ">Debug</Configuration>
    <Platform Condition=" '$(Platform)' == '' ">x86</Platform>

doesn't help for platform, but only for configuration. Works fine upon build though so please don't fix it, in order to keep it working. 

Thank you! :)
